CMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:31 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findblabla.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project has
  asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by "blabla", but
  CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "blabla" with any
  of the following names:

    blablaConfig.cmake
    blabla-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "blabla" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "blabla_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If "blabla"
  provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it has been
  installed.
